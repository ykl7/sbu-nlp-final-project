$ f:(0,1)\to r$ differentiable and $ f'(x)<1,\forall x\in ( 0,1)$. show $ \lim_{n\to \infty}f(\frac{1}{n})$ exists .  first i noticed that $ f'$ is not necessarily bounded , so we ca n't claim it 's uniformly continuous . so $ lim_{n\to \infty}f(\frac{1}{n})$ could be negative infinity . also the example $ f(x)=\frac{1}{x-1}$ shows even if $ f'$ is not bounded below , $ \lim_{n\to \infty}f(\frac{1}{n})$ can still be real number . so at first i thought i could discuss different cases but now it seems the cases are mixed together .

when i try to run cheese from terminal i receive this error message :  clutter - critical * * : unable to initialize clutter : unable to find suitable fbconfig for the glx context : unable to find fbconfig with rgba visual  obviously , seems to be something about this fbconfig , that i presume is connected to framebuffer . my sis video card uses framebuffer to display 1280x800 maximum resolution . in previous versions i had used cheese without problems .  someone can give me more light about this issue ?
we are given that $ $ \int\limits_{0}^\infty e^{-x^2}.dx=\alpha$$ then we need to find the value of $ $ \int\limits_{0}^{1}\sqrt{|lnx|}.dx$$ in terms of $ \alpha$.  what i did was to integrate the second integral by parts taking $ 1 $ as the first function and $ \sqrt{|lnx|}$ as the second .  this gave me $ $ \big[\sqrt{lnx}+x\big]_{0}^{1}-\frac12\int\frac{1}{\sqrt{lnx}}.dx$$  but i 'm stuck after this . i ca n't see what i should do to bring the above integral into play . can someone suggest something to move ahead or maybe some other method ?
give an example of a linear map $ t\epsilon \mathcal{l}(\mathbb{r}^4 \to \mathbb{r}^4)$ such that $ \text{null}(t ) = \text{range}(t)$.  i came up with $ $ \text{let}\ ( e_1 , e_2 , e_3 , e_4)\ \text{be a basis of}\ \mathbb{r}^4\ \text{and let}\ t \epsilon \mathcal{l}(\mathbb{r}^4 \to \mathbb{r}^4)\ \text{such that}$$ $ $ t(e_1)=t(e_2)=0$$$$t(e_3)=e_3$$$$t(e_4)=e_4$$.  is this example so trivial as to be invalid , and if so , what would have been a better example ?
i ca n't figure out how to solve ( say whether it converges or diverges ) the following improper integral :  $ $  \int \limits_{2}^{4}\frac{\sqrt{(16 - x^2)^5}}{(x^2 - 9x + 20)^3}dx  $ $  i 've tried to simplify this and got :  $ $  \int \limits_{2}^{4}\frac{(4 + x)^{5/2}}{(4 - x)^{1/2}(5 - x ) }  $ $  but i do n't know what to do next . could you please give me some hint

if i calculated correctly , the derivative has to be $ \dfrac{6{x}^{5}}{{\left({x}^{2}+1\right)}^{4}}{-\dfrac{8{x}^{7}}{{\left({x}^{2}+1\right)}^{5}}}$ which is equal to $ { -\dfrac{2{x}^{5}\left({x}^{2}{-3}\right)}{{\left({x}^{2}+1\right)}^{5}}}$ if i put into $ x=1 $ i will get of course $ 1/16 $ , but is it so a correct proof ?
